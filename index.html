        <br>
        <p>KAHE (Deemed-to-be University) has been consistently setting a record of campus placements amongst the top private universities in India and is proud that its students are highly rated by top employers across different sectors and industries. Besides being a catalyst in driving change in the education sector, the Student Career Advisory and Placement Support Team guides students in choosing suitable career options by facilitating to work for top companies in their respective sectors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Over 300 prospective recruiters have hired more than 4,500 students from our campuses across university over the last few years. This has been an outcome of a very precise placement process adopted by Team SCAPS. Dedicated placement team has always kept itself ahead of the peers by constantly innovating the hiring process thereby creating a niche for itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Apart from onboarding companies for Campus Placements, Team SCAPS also strives in narrowing the gap between institute and industry through various initiatives. A series of Guest Lectures are arranged regularly to keep students abreast of latest happenings in the industry. Workshops and Conferences are organized for all branches of students to have hands-on experience and also a platform to showcase their latest research work. Industrial visits are arranged especially for Non-IT branch students to have the first-hand experience of industry environment and to understand the working environment. As students connect well with their seniors, Alumni are roped in to give pep talks. This will help students understand the preparations required by them during the college days to become successful in their career.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            All the measures taken by Team SCAPS has been helping students to make an informed choice both for a career as well as higher studies. As students are more informed about various aspects of engineering they are finding it easy while choosing a right specialization in case they are planning for higher education. Our students have guided through team SCAPS in choosing courses for higher education either in India or abroad based on their interest and availability of right course. We counsel students and in some instances provide necessary training for competitive exams like GRE, GMAT, GATE, etc., in campus or in identifying best coaching centers.
